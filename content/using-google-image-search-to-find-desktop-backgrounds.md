I don't remember where I first saw this, but you can use the "imagesize"
parameter in Google Image Search to find pictures that fit your desktop
perfectly. In my case I have two size-by-side 19" monitors (not
widescreen). Therefore my total screen space is 2560 x 1024. A Google
image search for "[beach sunset imagesize:2560x1024][]" gives me a wide
variety of pictures to choose from without having to navigate desktop
wallpaper sites.
