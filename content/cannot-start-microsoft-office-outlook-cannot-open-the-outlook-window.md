I got this annoying error message this morning when trying to open
Outlook 2007.

    Cannot start Microsoft Office Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window.

I tried logging out and back in, which didn't help. Neither did a
restart. A quick Google search revealed the following solution:

1.  Click Start, then Run (alternatively, press WINDOWS-R). On Windows
    7, just click on the start button and use the quick search box.
2.  Type "Outlook.exe /resetnavpane" and press Enter.

</p>
Voila. Outlook fixed.
