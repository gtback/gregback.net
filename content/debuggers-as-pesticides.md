I thought this was funny:

> Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1 computer
> in 1961. At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging Tape". Since then,
> the idea of an on-line debugging program has propagated throughout the
> computer industry. DDT programs are now available for all DEC
> computers. Since media other than tape are now frequently used, the
> more descriptive name "Dynamic Debugging Technique" has been adopted,
> retaining the DDT abbreviation. Confusion between DDT-10 and another
> well known pesticide, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane C14H9Cl5
> should be minimal since each attacks a different, and apparently
> mutually exclusive, class of bugs.
