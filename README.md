## Hosting

This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/happy-newton-f3131d/overview). Any time a change is pushed to the master branch, the site will get rebuilt and published.

## Local Testing

Run `make html` to build the site locally, or `make serve` to launch a [local server](http://localhost:8000).
