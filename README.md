# gregback.net

My blog/website at [https://gregback.net](https://gregback.net).

## Hosting

This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/happy-newton-f3131d/overview). Any time a change is pushed to the `main` branch, the site will get rebuilt and published.

## Local Testing

Run `make html` to build the site locally, or `make serve` to launch a [local server](http://localhost:8000).

Run `make devserver` to run a server and automatically rebuild any files that are modified.
